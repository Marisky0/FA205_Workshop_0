# FA205_Workshop_0
Introductory workshop to p5.js and creative coding. I was introduced to some coding concepts, how p5.js operates and resources to help with my learning. I then experimented with changing the shape, colour and transparency of the sketch.

## Notes

## Problem solving 
This sketch was quite simple and I only explored how to change the different parameters. Next time I would explore how I could have more than one shape acting on the same action in the sketch.
